# Introduction to Functional Programming in Javascript

I mentioned previously that there is a youtube channel which is worth following. It is called fun fun funciton, and luckily this guy has a whole [playlist about functional programming in Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84).

This video series is great, you should definitely watch it. That is why I will only highlight some important aspects which you should know.

The most important concepts of this lesson are:
 - Functions are Objects!
   - you can add properties to functions
   - you can pass them to other functions as function parameters
   - you can return functions from funtions
 - Function Scoping (vs. Block scoping)
 - Closures
 - Higher-Order Functions

And we mentioned the [Module Pattern](https://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern/), since it separates your code from the global scope with a function scope.

There are multiple very useful Array functions which will help you to think in a functional manner:
 - [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/hu/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)
 - [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/hu/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
 - [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/hu/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
 - [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
 - [find](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
 - [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/hu/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)
 - [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/hu/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)
 - etc

If you use them with the new [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/hu/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) syntax, then you can save a lot of boilerplate code, thus you will be more efficient.
